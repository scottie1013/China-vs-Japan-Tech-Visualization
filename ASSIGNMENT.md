# DSCI 554 Assignment: Create Dashboards With Interactive Charts

## Description

### Objective

In this assignment, you will implement a simplified dashboard design to compare the two countries. You will use generative AI tools to assist you in the implementation.

## Dashboard Development

Follow these guidelines to develop the dashboard:
   1. Simplify the single-page design of the previous assignment:
      - Include *at least 4* d3 charts we already covered in class (table, scatterplots, bar charts, and line charts)
      - Demonstrate *at least 3* interactive single-display features with *at least one transition*
   2. Demonstrate using Bootstrap for controls, styling, and layout.
   3. Ensure that:
      - D3 with data join is used to implement all graphics
      - Use `npm install` to install the necessary packages. **Using Javascript libraries from CDN is not allowed.**
      - Consider using separate files for each graphic to simplify testing and integration.

## Submission

Complete the template provided in the `README.md`:
- Document how you used generative AI, including links and explanations to your interactions. If public links cannot be generated (e.g., when using images in chat), you can upload and cite a PDF that includes the pictures and a transcript of the chat.
- Provide links to the simplified design.
- List the interactive features you have implemented.
- List how you used Bootstrap for controls, styling, and layout.
- Ensure that the dashboard is functional and displays correctly in Google Chrome and that there are no errors in DevTools when launched.


## Rubrics

|                     | **Dashboard Implementation** |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Sophisticated** | The dashboard is well-implemented. Bootstrap is used for controls, styling, and layout. At least 4 d3 charts are included. At least 3 interactive single-display features and one transition are demonstrated. D3 data join is properly used. All necessary packages are included with npm. Generative AI is effectively used for the implementation. All requested information is provided in the README.md. (4-5 pts). |
| **Competent**     | The dashboard includes at least 3 D3 charts and some interactivity. Bootstrap is used for styling, but some elements may lack polish. D3 data join is attempted but may not be fully correct. Some necessary packages are included with npm, but there may be minor issues with dependencies. README.md provides basic information but lacks some requested details. (2-3 pts). |
| **Needs Work**    | he dashboard has fewer than 3 D3 charts or lacks interactivity. Bootstrap may be missing or improperly applied. D3 data join is not used correctly, or the implementation is incomplete. Missing required npm packages. README.md is incomplete or missing. (0-1 pt). |


## Homework Guidelines

- The homework repository must be updated before the deadline.
- Commits after the deadline will not be considered unless requested.
- **Late policy**: 10% of total available points deducted per each late day; any submission delayed by less than 24 hours counts as one full day.
- The homework is expected to work inside the dev container.
